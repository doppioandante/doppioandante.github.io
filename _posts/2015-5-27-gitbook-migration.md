title: Migrating to Gitbook
---

The short tutorial I'm writing about the STL is going to be continued on gitbook.
I found it to be better suited for it, because of the useful plugins and the
nice extra features such as pdf/ebook export and such.

I'll be translating the first chapter in English as well, and I'll continue
onwards in both languages.

You can find the book [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/doppioandante/understanding-the-standard-template-library/details)
