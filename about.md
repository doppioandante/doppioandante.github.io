I am Enrico Lumetti, currently undergraduate student at the university of
Padua (Computer Engineering).
I usually spend my time lost in my thoughts, but when I'm not, I like listening
to music, playing the piano or the bass and discussing about crazy stuff.

Besides Computer Science, my main interests are technology, mathematics,
computational science (biology), programming languages design, philosophy,
foreign languages and contemporary Italian literature.

This blog will be written in both English and Italian.
